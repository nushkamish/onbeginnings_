            "It is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk 
            about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it 
            begins off the page, it begins in the mind."

                </span> its beginning. <span class="hidden"> Because </span> the poem <span class="hidden">
                ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it</span> begins <span class="hidden"> in the mind.</span> The mind acts,
               <span class="hidden"> the mind wills a poem, </span> often against our own will; <span class="hidden">
                somehow this happens, somehow</span> a poem gets written <span class="hidden"> in the middle of a chaotic holiday party 
                that has just run out of ice, </span> and it's your house.

            <p> An act of the mind.<span class="hidden">To move, to make happen, to make, to manifest. Be an act of Congress. 
                A state of real existence rather than possibility. </span>  And poets love  <span class="hidden">possibility! They love to wonder 
                and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has </span> to exist!
                <span class="hidden"> To conduct oneself, to behave. How </span>  a poem acts  <span class="hidden"> marks its individual character.
                </span>  A poem<span class="hidden"> by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate.</span> That, <span class="hidden">
                    too, yes and always, because</span>  self-consciousness <span class="hidden">  is its own pretension, and has been</span> from its beginning;
               <span class="hidden">  the human mind </span> is capable of a great  <span class="hidden">
                elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of </span> weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what
                goes on around us every day of our lives; <span class="hidden"> an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in </span> 
                his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw <span class="hidden">a circle around the action and observe it
                 from outside the circle; in other words, </span> self-consciousness is theatre.

        <div class="para3">
            <p>Everyone knows  <span class="hidden">that if you query poets about how their poems begin,</span> the answer is always the same:  
         <span class="hidden"> a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, </span>  something seen <span class="hidden">  heard, witnessed, or imagined.
                </span>  And the lesson is  <span class="hidden"> always the same, and young </span> poets recognize <span class="hidden">
                    this to be one of the most important lessons </span> they can learn: <span class="hidden"> if you have any idea for a poem,</span> an exact grid of intent, you are on 
               <span class="hidden"> the wrong path,  </span>  a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven't even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.
