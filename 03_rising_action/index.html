    I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, <br>
    but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it<strong> <em>too loudly,</em> </strong><br>
    they will get the wrong idea.

      Now here is something really interesting (to me),<br>
      something you can use at a standing-up-only party when <br>
      everyone is tired of hearing there are  <br> 
       
       <span class="numbers"><br> one million 
       <br>three thousand <br>two hundred<br>ninety five <br> </span>

       <br>
       words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound <br>
       learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so  constructed—English  <br>
       among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. <br>
  
      </div>

      <div class="para3 fade-in" span>
        <span class="line1">That sentence begins with your first words, <br> </span>
        <span class="line2">toddling around the kitchen, <br> </span> 
        <span class="line3">and ends with your last words, <br> </span>
        <span class="line4">right before you step into <br> </span> 
        <span class="line5"> the limousine, <br> </span>
        <span class="line6">or in a nursing home, <br> </span>
        <span class="line7">the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. <br><br> </span>
        <span class="line8">Or, if you are blessed, <br></span>
        <span class="line9"> they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be <br></span>
        <span class="line10"> and loves you and will be.  </span> <br>
        <span class="line11"> sorry to hear the sentence end.  </span>

        When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: <br>
        “Thats a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; <br>
        the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the  <br>
        novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon <br>
        (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) <br>
        you should <span class="stop">stop.</span> <br> <br> <br>
       <br> <br> <br> 
       <span class="thankful">*be thankful that there exists this little thing, <br>
        invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go <br>
        on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated;</span>
