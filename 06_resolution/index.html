opening lines: remember, first lines, are remarkable

        I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, 
        across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered 
        that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are
        remarkably similar, even repeated. 

        </div>

        <br>    <br>    <br> 

<div class="pause1">
    
    hold on. breathe.

    </div>

    <br>   <br>   <br>

    <div class=" para2">

        Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong 
        to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading these first and 
        last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence 
        we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered 
        to use by others, by those we listen to.

        </div>

        <br>   <br>  <br>    <br> <br>

    <div class="pause2">

        And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:

    <br>   <br> <br>    <br> <br>

    <div class="para3">

        in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out 
        of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain:

    </div>

    <br>   <br>  <br>   <br> <br>    

    <div class="words">
        <br>   <br>
        <br>   <br>
    <div class="love1">
i love you
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="love2">

            i am here with you 

        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <div class="love3">

            don't be afraid

        </div>
<br> <br>

        <div class="love4">
go to sleep now.

        </div>

        </div>

<br> <br> <br> <br>
    <div class="pause3">

        And I encountered words that mark the last something 
        made out of language that we hope to hear on earth:

                        Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter).
                         A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound,
                          cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, 
                          her whole life,
